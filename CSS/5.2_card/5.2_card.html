      <h1>Berghain</h1>
      <p class="info">Sitting in a dusty lot on the border of Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain in Berlin, Berghain is widely considered one of the world's best nightclubs. It has three dance floors: Berghain, a dark main room where most DJs play techno, Panorama Bar, an upstairs space that's more focused on house, and the Säule on ground floor, though the music policy in all rooms is very open-ended. Most of the parties are extremely long: Friday night events usually wrap up early Saturday afternoon, but Saturdays typically run well into Monday morning. Perhaps the most notorious aspect of the club is its door policy—hundreds of people are turned away each weekend, including regulars, often for reasons that are completely mysterious to everyone except the doormen.</p>
